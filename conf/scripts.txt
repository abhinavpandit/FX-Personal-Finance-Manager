NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN
Ed : I was sheriff of this county when I was twenty-five years old. Hard to believe. Grandfather was a lawman. Father too. Me and him was sheriffs at the same time, him up in Plano and me out here. I think he was pretty proud of that. I know I was. Some of the old-time sheriffs never even wore a gun. A lot of folks find that hard to believe. Jim Scarborough never carried one. That the younger Jim. Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one up in Commanche County. Now I always liked to hear about the old-timers. Never missed a chance to do so. You can't help but compare yourself against the old-timers. Can't help but wonder how they would've operated these times. There is this boy I sent to the electric chair in Huntsville here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killed a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it. Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said if they turned him out he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. Be there in about fifteen minutes. I don't know what to make of that. I surely don't. The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure. It's not that I'm afraid of it. I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job. But I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand. A man would have to put his soul at hazard. He just has to say, "Okay. I'll be part of this world." 
 Carla : What's in the satchel?

Llewellyn : It's full of money.

Llewellyn : At the gettin' place.
Carla : Did you buy that gun?
Llewellyn : No. I found it.

Llewellyn : You don't need to know everything, Carla Jean.
Carla : I need to know that.
Llewellyn : Running that mouth of yours I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Carla : Big talk.
Llewellyn : Keep it up.
Carla : Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Llewellyn : That'll work.

Man : Alright. Heads then.
Chigurh : Well done.
 
 # FRIENDS
 Ronni : Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Chandler : Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
Ronni : That's a good one!
Mr. Tribbiani : Hey, Joe.
Joey : Dad, Ronni's here.
Mr. Tribbiani : Huh?
Ronni : Hi.
Mr. Tribbiani : Hey! Hello, babe! Wh... what're what're you doing here?
Ronni : Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
Mr. Tribbiani : Thank you. Uh...
Chandler : So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Ronni : Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.
Mr. Tribbiani : I don't want you taking that thing.
Ronni : Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
Joey : Who-ah-ho.
Mr. Tribbiani : We'll go to a hotel.
Ronni : We'll go to a hotel.
Joey : No you won't.
Ronni : No we won't.
Joey : If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
Mr. Tribbiani : You're gonna keep an eye on us?
Joey : That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Ronni : Wow. He's strict.
Joey : Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Ronni : Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
Chandler : C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Joey : Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. Six years is long enough.
Mr. Tribbiani : What kinda change?
Joey : Well, either you break it off with Ronni.
Mr. Tribbiani : I can't do that!
Joey : Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Mr. Tribbiani : Yeah, but this is...
Joey : I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Chandler : Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Joey : Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Chandler : Well, you're gonna.
Joey : I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Chandler : Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Joey : Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Chandler : Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
Joey : No.
Chandler : No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
Joey : You really think so?
Chandler : Yeah. I really do.
Joey : Thanks, Chandler.
Chandler : Get off! 

Janice : I brought you something.
Chandler : Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
Janice : I had them made special.
Chandler : Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't think things are gonna work out.
Janice : That's fine.
Chandler : It is?
Janice : Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
Chandler : Oh no, you see, actually it is.
Janice : No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
Chandler : Oh, no I don't.
Janice : Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
Chandler : I did, but...
Janice : You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
Chandler : Call me!
Carol : It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
Ross : You did so. I swear, I swear. How long has she been in the bathroom?
Carol : Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
Ross : Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
Carol : That could be it.
Ross : Oh, God. You know, this is still pretty hot.
Carol : Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny.
Ross : No, it's just...well you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Do I have to? I mean, I'm, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, you know, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...
Carol : I know.
Ross : You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot?
Carol : Ross.
Ross : No no no, I know you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But let's... what do you say we just put that asidefor now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how, how perfect is that?
Carol : Ross.
Ross : But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
Carol : Oh, I love you too. But...
Ross : No but, no but.
Carol : You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out.
Ross : Yeah.
Carol : You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
Ross : That's easy for you to say, you've found one already.
Carol : All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set. Not her.
 
 Joey : Vulva?
Ross : Alright, I panicked, alright? She, she took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Joey : Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times?
Ross : Shut up! It was mine. I just... I just I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Joey : What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Try something on me.
Ross : Please be kidding.
Joey : Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
Ross : OK. I'm, I'm in my apartment... 
Joey : Yeah... what else?
Ross : That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Joey : Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Ross : Joey, please.
Joey : Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Ross : Wow.
Joey : Alright, now you say something.
Ross : I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Joey : Come on! You like this woman, right?
Ross : Yeah.
Joey : You want to see her again, right?
Ross : Sure.
Joey : Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
Ross : OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Joey : Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Ross : Ahem... I want... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
Joey : There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
Ross : I, er... I want to take my tongue... and... and...
Joey : Say it... say it!
Ross : ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
Chandler :...with??
Ross : Funny story!
Joey : You're not going to believe this!
Chandler : It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Joey : Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Chandler : Again?
Joey : And again, and again, and again...
Chandler : Hello?
Joey : And again.
Chandler : Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous, er, but look, this isn't about the money. You know, just I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday! 

Chandler : It's not just that she's cute, okay. It's just that... she's really really cute.
Ross : It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
Monica : Ross, your little creature's got the remote again.
Ross : Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Monica : Great.
Ross : Relax, I'll fix it.
Rachel : Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
Ross : How did he do this?
Chandler : So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Monica : Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's... but obviously someone forgot.
Rachel : Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
Chandler : Hey, where you been?
Joey : I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries.
Chandler : Score.
Joey : She is so hot!
Chandler : Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...
Joey : Pheebs?
Phoebe : Yeah?
Joey : You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
Phoebe : Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
Joey : So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there.
Phoebe : Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, it's true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we've grown apart, so, um... I don't know, why not? Okay.
Joey : Cool, thanks.
Ross : You okay?
Phoebe : Yeah I'm fine.
Ross : You wanna watch Laverney Shirley?
Ross : Sorry.
Ross : Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's, where's Carol?
Susan : Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
Ross : No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know what's going on.
Susan : Oh, good. This'll be fun.
Teacher : Alrighty. We're gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why don't you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummy's head.
Ross and Susan : What? What? What?
Susan : I am supposed to be the mommy?
Ross : Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
Susan : Look, I don't see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.
Ross : I see. So what do you propose to do?
Susan : I will flip you for it.
Ross : Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
Susan : On your back... Mom.
Teacher : Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
Teacher : Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
Chandler : Mr. D, how's it going, sir?
Mr. Douglas : Ohh, it's been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
Chandler : And?
Mr. Douglas : It's pretty ugly. We haven't seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
Chandler : So what does this mean?
Mr. Douglas : Well, we're gonna be laying off people in every department.
Chandler : Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very dash;
Mr. Douglas : Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
Chandler : Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
Nina : Are you okay?
Chandler : Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please don't hate me.
Nina : What?
Chandler : Would you like to have dinner sometime?  

Rachel : Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! Dead!
Monica : Ross, he's got the remote again.
Ross : Good. Maybe he can switch it back. Maybe not.
Rachel : Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if she if she's here.
Rachel : It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Rachel and Monica : Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Monica : I don't know! Why don't you just explain? Find out what do they want? Find out what they want!
Rachel : Okay, no, you do it.
Monica : Hello, this is Monica... Yeah? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you.
Rachel : What?
Monica : We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Rachel : Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
Monica : Thank you.
Rachel : Okay, let me just change.
Monica : Yes.
Joey : Hey.
Ross and Chandler : Hey!
Monica : Hi.
Phoebe : Trouble?
Joey : Your sister stood me up the other night.
Phoebe : Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
Ross : Well did you try calling her?
Joey : I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowing me off.
Phoebe : Hey.
Ursula : Oh!
Phoebe : Um you, you got a minute?
Ursula : Um, yeah, I'm just...working.
Phoebe : So.
Ursula : Uh-huh.
Phoebe : Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.
Ursula : Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!
Phoebe : Right, like the kind you...
Ursula : Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.
Phoebe : How'd you know I was coming?
Ursula : Um, yeah, um, twin thing.
Phoebe : I can't believe you did this. I can't believe you...did this.
Phoebe : So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
Ursula : Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
Phoebe : Does he know?
Ursula : Who?
Phoebe : Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
Ursula : He is? Why?
Phoebe : You got me.
Ursula : Right.
Ursula : Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?
Phoebe : So, um, are you gonna call him?
Ursula : What? You think he likes me?
Phoebe : No, Joey.
Ursula : Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken?
Phoebe : No. No. No food with a face.
Ursula : You have not changed!
Phoebe : Yeah, you too.
Rachel : Hi, remember us?
Nurse : Mmm hmmm.
Monica : Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um...
Nurse : You're that stupid.
Monica : I am. I'm that stupid.
Rachel : Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
Nurse : Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
Rachel : Yeah, I know... I'm I'm just not that bright either.
 
 Rachel : Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?
Phoebe : Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
Ross : No, women are welcome to play.
Phoebe : Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... uh, what is it?
Chandler : There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
Joey : Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Girls : Oh, yeah, right.
Monica : Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!!
Rachel : Really.
Monica : I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Ross : Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Girls : No.
Rachel : But you could teach us.
Guys : No.
Chandler : OK, so now we draw cards.
Monica : So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
Rachel : Oh, good for you!
Phoebe : Congratulations!
Chandler : OK Phoebs, how many do you want?
Phoebe : OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
Ross : No, uh, Phoebs? You can't-you can't do...
Rachel : Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!
Ross : No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Rachel : Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no, that's OK, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours.
Ross : Oh, you're...
Monica : Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites.
Phoebe and Rachel : Ooooooo!
Joey : Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz...
Chandler : OK, so at this point, the dealer...
Monica : Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes ... big bucks...
Ross : Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
Phoebe : But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Chandler : OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe.
Monica : Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Phoebe : Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
Joey : About what?
Phoebe : About how good your cards were.
Joey : Heh... I was bluffing.
Phoebe : A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for lying?
Rachel : OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow...
Guys : Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Chandler : Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.
Rachel : Settle what?
Chandler : The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...
Ross : The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Rachel : Oh. Right.
Joey : You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
Monica : Hell no, we'll pay!
Phoebe : OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Monica : And you know what? We want a rematch.
Ross : Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Rachel : So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.
Ross :...Yeah.
Chandler : Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.
Ross : Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
